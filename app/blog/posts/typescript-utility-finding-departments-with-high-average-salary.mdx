When working with employee data, it's often necessary to perform analytics based on specific criteria. One such task is identifying **which departments have a higher-than-average salary** compared to a threshold. In this post, we'll explore a utility function in TypeScript that does exactly that — filtering departments based on their average salary.

## The Code

```ts
type Employee = {
  name: string;
  department: string;
  salary: number;
};

export const getDepartmentsWithHighAverageSalary = (
  users: Employee[] | null | undefined,
  salaryThreshold: number
): string[] => {
  if (!Array.isArray(users)) return [];

  const deptStats = users.reduce<
    Record<string, { total: number; count: number }>
  >((acc, user) => {
    if (!acc[user.department]) {
      acc[user.department] = { total: 0, count: 0 };
    }

    acc[user.department].total += user.salary;
    acc[user.department].count += 1;

    return acc;
  }, {});

  return Object.entries(deptStats)
    .filter(([_, { total, count }]) => total / count > salaryThreshold)
    .map(([department]) => department);
};
```

## Code Breakdown with Sample Output

Let's break the function down step-by-step and see it in action with a sample dataset.

## Function Recap

```ts
type Employee = {
  name: string;
  department: string;
  salary: number;
};

export const getDepartmentsWithHighAverageSalary = (
  users: Employee[] | null | undefined,
  salaryThreshold: number
): string[] => {
  if (!Array.isArray(users)) return [];

  const deptStats = users.reduce<
    Record<string, { total: number; count: number }>
  >((acc, user) => {
    if (!acc[user.department]) {
      acc[user.department] = { total: 0, count: 0 };
    }

    acc[user.department].total += user.salary;
    acc[user.department].count += 1;

    return acc;
  }, {});

  return Object.entries(deptStats)
    .filter(([_, { total, count }]) => total / count > salaryThreshold)
    .map(([department]) => department);
};
```

## Sample Input

```ts
const employees: Employee[] = [
  { name: "Alice", department: "Engineering", salary: 95000 },
  { name: "Bob", department: "Engineering", salary: 105000 },
  { name: "Charlie", department: "Sales", salary: 60000 },
  { name: "Diana", department: "Sales", salary: 65000 },
  { name: "Eve", department: "Marketing", salary: 50000 },
  { name: "Frank", department: "Marketing", salary: 48000 },
];

const result = getDepartmentsWithHighAverageSalary(employees, 70000);
console.log(result);
```

## How It Works

1. **Initial validation**:<br />
   If employees is null or undefined, it returns [].

2. **Reduce step**:<br />
   It groups employees by department, summing their salaries and counting entries.

- Engineering: Total = 200,000; Count = 2 → Avg = 100,000
- Sales: Total = 125,000; Count = 2 → Avg = 62,500
- Marketing: Total = 98,000; Count = 2 → Avg = 49,000

3. **Filtering**:<br />
   Only departments where average salary > 70,000 are kept.

4. **Mapping**:<br />
   Returns just the department names.

## Output

```ts
["Engineering"];
```

## Why Only Engineering?

Because:

- **Engineering Avg**: (95000 + 105000) / 2 = 100,000
- **Sales Avg**: (60000 + 65000) / 2 = 62,500
- **Marketing Avg**: (50000 + 48000) / 2 = 49,000

Only **Engineering** has an average salary greater than <code>70,000</code>.

## Key Points

- **Type-Safety with Employee Interface**<br />
  Each employee is represented by a name, <code>department</code>, and <code>salary</code>. This ensures clear expectations on data structure.

- **Null-Safe Input Handling**<br />
  Before proceeding, the function checks if <code>users</code> is a valid array — useful for avoiding runtime errors with <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.

- **Departmental Aggregation**<br />
  Using <code>reduce</code>, the function aggregates total salaries and counts for each department.

- **Average Calculation**<br />
  Departments are filtered based on whether thei**r average salary** <code>(total / count)</code> exceeds the <code>salaryThreshold</code>.

- **Functional, Readable Approach**<br />
  The combination of <code>reduce</code>, <code>Object.entries</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>map</code> keeps the logic clean and declarative.

## When This Is Useful

- **HR Dashboards or Reports**: To highlight high-earning departments.
- **Auditing Salary Distribution**: For internal salary reviews or budget planning.
- **Access Control**: If high-paid departments are granted premium features.

## When Not To Use This

- **Real-Time Data with Frequent Changes**<br />
  If your data changes often and performance is critical, consider memoization or aggregating data in a database instead.

- **Complex Salary Structures**<br />
  If salary needs to be normalized, adjusted for bonuses, or calculated from multiple sources, this simple average approach won’t be enough.

- **Very Large Datasets in Browser**<br />
  For large-scale datasets, pushing this logic to a backend or using a data processing library might be more performant.

## Final Thoughts

This utility is a **neat and practical solution** when you need quick insights into salary distributions across departments. While it's excellent for small to medium datasets or server-side batch processing, for more complex or large-scale scenarios, consider database-level aggregation or data streaming techniques.

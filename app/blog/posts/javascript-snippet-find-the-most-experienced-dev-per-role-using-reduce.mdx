Ever had a list of engineers and wanted to quickly figure out who's been around the longest in each role? Maybe for a dev team dashboard, contributor stats, or company leaderboard?

Here's a short, powerful function in **JavaScript or TypeScript** that does just that.

## The Dev Team

We'll work with this sample **Developer** type:

```ts
type Developer = {
  name: string;
  role: string;
  yearsOfExperience: number;
};
```

## The Goal

From a list of developers, **get the most experienced person for each unique role** (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, etc.).

## The Function

Here’s the utility function that makes it happen:

```ts
export const getMostExperiencedPerRole = (
  devs: Developer[] | null | undefined
): Record<string, { name: string; yearsOfExperience: number }> => {
  if (!Array.isArray(devs)) return {};

  return devs.reduce<
    Record<string, { name: string; yearsOfExperience: number }>
  >((acc, dev) => {
    const current = acc[dev.role];

    if (!current || dev.yearsOfExperience > current.yearsOfExperience) {
      acc[dev.role] = {
        name: dev.name,
        yearsOfExperience: dev.yearsOfExperience,
      };
    }

    return acc;
  }, {});
};
```

## Example Data

Let’s try it with a realistic dev team:

```ts
const devTeam: Developer[] = [
  { name: "Alice", role: "Frontend Engineer", yearsOfExperience: 3 },
  { name: "Bob", role: "Backend Engineer", yearsOfExperience: 5 },
  { name: "Charlie", role: "Frontend Engineer", yearsOfExperience: 6 },
  { name: "Diana", role: "DevOps", yearsOfExperience: 4 },
  { name: "Eve", role: "Backend Engineer", yearsOfExperience: 7 },
  { name: "Frank", role: "DevOps", yearsOfExperience: 2 },
];
```

Now call the function:

```ts
const topDevs = getMostExperiencedPerRole(devTeam);

console.log(topDevs);
```

## Output

```ts
{
  'Frontend Engineer': { name: 'Charlie', yearsOfExperience: 6 },
  'Backend Engineer': { name: 'Eve', yearsOfExperience: 7 },
  DevOps: { name: 'Diana', yearsOfExperience: 4 }
}

```

## Why This Works

- We use <code>.reduce()</code> to walk through the array once.
- For each dev:
  - If no one in that role is stored yet, we add them.
  - If they have more experience than the current one, we update the record.

This gives you a flat object where each key is a role, and each value is the most experienced person in that role.

## Use Cases

- Dev team dashboards
- Contributor recognition features
- Performance reports
- Internal admin tools

## Final Thoughts

This is a great example of how <code>.reduce()</code> isn't just for summing numbers — it can power up your data transformation logic in very readable and performant ways.

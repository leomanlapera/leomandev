When building admin dashboards or analytics views, it's common to report on user activity — especially by user roles like admin, editor, or viewer. In this post, we'll walk through a small utility function in TypeScript that **counts active users grouped by their role**, and we'll include **unit tests** to ensure it behaves correctly.

## The Function: countActiveUsersByRole

Let's say you receive a list of user objects like this:

```ts
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  role: "admin",
  isActive: true
}
```

Your goal is to count how many **active users** exist for each **role**. Here's the function that does exactly that:

```ts
export const countActiveUsersByRole = (
  users:
    | Array<{
        id: number;
        name: string;
        role: string;
        isActive: boolean;
      }>
    | null
    | undefined
) => {
  if (!Array.isArray(users)) return {};

  return users
    .filter((user) => user.isActive)
    .reduce<Record<string, number>>((acc, user) => {
      acc[user.role] = (acc[user.role] || 0) + 1;
      return acc;
    }, {});
};
```

## How it works

1. **Guard Clause**: Returns an empty object if **users** is **null**, **undefined**, or not an array.
2. **Filter**: Keeps only users where **isActive === true**.
3. **Reduce**: Accumulates a count of active users by their **role**.

## Unit Tests with Jest

To make sure our function behaves correctly, here are some test cases:

```ts
import { countActiveUsersByRole } from "./countActiveUsersByRole";

describe("countActiveUsersByRole", () => {
  const users = [
    { id: 1, name: "Alice", role: "admin", isActive: true },
    { id: 2, name: "Bob", role: "editor", isActive: false },
    { id: 3, name: "Charlie", role: "admin", isActive: true },
    { id: 4, name: "Dave", role: "editor", isActive: true },
    { id: 5, name: "Eve", role: "viewer", isActive: true },
  ];

  it("returns active users with role as key and value as count", () => {
    const result = countActiveUsersByRole(users);
    expect(result).toEqual({ admin: 2, editor: 1, viewer: 1 });
  });

  it("returns an empty object if non-array is passed", () => {
    expect(countActiveUsersByRole(null)).toEqual({});
  });
});
```

## Explanation of Tests

- **Test 1**: Ensures active users are counted by their role.
- **Test 2**: Ensures the function safely handles **null** or invalid input.

## Bonus: Why This Is Useful

This utility function is perfect for use in:

- Admin dashboards
- Analytics reports
- Role-based access summaries

It's also type-safe, defensive (handles edge cases), and easy to test.

## Wrap-up

This function is a great example of **clean functional logic** combined with **type safety** and **unit testing**. It's small but solves a real-world need in many backend and frontend apps.

**Need this in your project? Just copy and paste the code — and don't forget to
add tests.**

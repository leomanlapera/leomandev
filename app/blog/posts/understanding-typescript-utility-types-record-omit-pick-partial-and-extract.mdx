TypeScript comes with built-in utility types that help us transform and work with types more effectively. Hereâ€™s a quick and beginner-friendly guide to five of the most commonly used ones.

## Record`<Keys, Type>`

What it does: Creates an object type with specific keys, and all values having the same type.

```ts
type UserRole = "admin" | "editor" | "viewer";

const roles: Record<UserRole, boolean> = {
  admin: true,
  editor: false,
  viewer: true,
};
```

Think of it as: An object where every key is required and the values all follow a single type.

## Omit`<Type, Keys>`

What it does: Removes specific keys from a type.

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type PublicUser = Omit<User, "email">;
```

Result: `PublicUser` will have only `id` and `name`.

## Pick`<Type, Keys>`

What it does: Selects specific keys from a type.

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type UserPreview = Pick<User, "name" | "email">;
```

Result: `UserPreview` will only include `name` and `email`.

## Partial`<Type>`

What it does: Makes all properties optional.

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
};

type UpdateUser = Partial<User>;
```

Result: `UpdateUser` can be `{}`, `{ id: "123" }`, or `{ name: "John" }`.

## Extract`<Type, Union>`

What it does: Extracts only the types that are shared between two unions.

```ts
type Roles = "admin" | "editor" | "user";
type AllowedRoles = Extract<Roles, "admin" | "user">;
```

Result: `AllowedRoles` will be `'admin' | 'user'`.

## Summary

```table
| Utility   | What it does                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Record`  | Create an object with fixed keys and value types |
| `Omit`    | Remove keys from a type                          |
| `Pick`    | Select only specific keys from a type            |
| `Partial` | Make all fields optional                         |
| `Extract` | Keep only matching values from a union           |
```

Tip: These utilities are great for building reusable, flexible types. They're simple but powerful once you get the hang of them!

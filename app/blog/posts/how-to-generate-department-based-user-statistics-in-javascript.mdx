When working with user data, it's often necessary to group and analyze users by departments, roles, or other categories. In this post, we'll walk through a simple utility function that calculates total users and how many are currently active in each department.

## The Dataset

Suppose we have an array of user objects like this:

```ts
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice", department: "Engineering", isActive: true },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob", department: "Marketing", isActive: false },
  { id: 3, name: "Charlie", department: "Engineering", isActive: true },
  { id: 4, name: "Dave", department: "Sales", isActive: true },
  { id: 5, name: "Eve", department: "Engineering", isActive: false },
  { id: 6, name: "Faythe", department: "Sales", isActive: true },
];
```

Each user belongs to a **department** and has an **isActive** status.

## The Utility Function

Let's create a function that takes this array and returns a breakdown of how many users exist in each department, along with how many are currently active:

```ts
export const getUserStatsByDepartment = (
  users:
    | Array<{
        id: number;
        name: string;
        department: string;
        isActive: boolean;
      }>
    | null
    | undefined
) => {
  if (!Array.isArray(users)) return {};

  return users.reduce<Record<string, { total: number; active: number }>>(
    (acc, user) => {
      const { department, isActive } = user;

      if (!acc[department]) {
        acc[department] = { total: 0, active: 0 };
      }

      acc[department].total += 1;

      if (isActive) {
        acc[department].active += 1;
      }

      return acc;
    },
    {}
  );
};
```

## How It Works

1. **Input Validation**: We first check if the **users** input is a valid array. If not, we return an empty object.
2. **Reduce Logic**: We use <code>reduce()</code> to accumulate department-level stats into a single object.
3. **Dynamic Keys**: For each user, we use their **department** as a dynamic key in the accumulator.
4. **Stat Tracking**: We increment the **total** for every user and the **active** count only if **isActive** is **true**.

## Example Output

Calling the function like so:

```ts
getUserStatsByDepartment(users);
```

...returns:

```ts
{
  Engineering: { total: 3, active: 2 },
  Marketing: { total: 1, active: 0 },
  Sales: { total: 2, active: 2 },
}
```

## Why This Is Useful

This pattern is useful in many real-world scenarios:

- **Admin dashboards**: Show active staff per department.
- **Team overviews**: See who's actively working in different segments.
- **HR tools**: Filter and analyze workforce metrics by categories.

You can even extend this function to support filtering by role, location, or other fields by slightly tweaking the logic.

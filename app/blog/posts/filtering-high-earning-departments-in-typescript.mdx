When analyzing employee data, a common requirement is to extract insights based on departments. One such use case is identifying **departments with above-average salaries**.

Let's walk through a simple but powerful function written in Typescript that accomplishes just that.

## The Problem

You're given a list of employees with their name, department, and salary. You want to return a list of department names where the **average salary** exceeds a specified threshold.

## The Data Structure

Here's the <code>Employee</code> type we're working with:

```ts
type Employee = {
  name: string;
  department: string;
  salary: number;
};
```

## The Function: <code>getDepartmentsWithHighAverageSalary</code>

```ts
export const getDepartmentsWithHighAverageSalary = (
  users: Employee[] | null | undefined,
  salaryThreshold: number
): string[] => {
  if (!Array.isArray(users)) return [];

  const deptStats = users.reduce<
    Record<string, { total: number; count: number }>
  >((acc, user) => {
    if (!acc[user.department]) {
      acc[user.department] = { total: 0, count: 0 };
    }

    acc[user.department].total += user.salary;
    acc[user.department].count += 1;

    return acc;
  }, {});

  return Object.entries(deptStats)
    .filter(([_, { total, count }]) => total / count > salaryThreshold)
    .map(([department]) => department);
};
```

## How It Works

1. **Input validation**: First, we check if the <code>users</code> input is a valid array. If not, we return an empty array.

2. **Aggregate data by department**: using <code>.reduce</code>, we build a lookup object (<code>deepStats</code>) that accumulates:

   - total salary per department
   - number of employees per department

3. **Calculate averages**: We use <code>Object.entries</code> to iterate over each department's data and filter out those whose average salary is below the threshold.

4. **Return result**: Finally, we return just the department names that meet the criteria.

## Example Usage

```ts
const employees: Employee[] = [
  { name: "Alice", department: "Engineering", salary: 120000 },
  { name: "Bob", department: "Engineering", salary: 110000 },
  { name: "Charlie", department: "HR", salary: 60000 },
  { name: "Diana", department: "HR", salary: 65000 },
];

const highPaying = getDepartmentsWithHighAverageSalary(employees, 100000);
console.log(highPaying); // ["Engineering"]
```

## Type Safety + Edge Case Handling

This function gracefully handles <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> input, thanks to the <code>Array.isArray</code> check. It's also fully typed with TypeScript for better DX (developer experience) and fewer runtime surprises.

## Final Thoughts

This pattern&mdash;grouping and aggregating data&mdash;is ver common in real-world applications like reporting dashboards, HR systems, or analytics engines.

You can easily adapt this logic for things like:

- Filtering top-performing sales regions
- Calculating average product ratings
- Analyzing time-tracking data

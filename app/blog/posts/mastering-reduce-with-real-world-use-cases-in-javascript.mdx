One of the most versatile tools in **JavaScript** is the .reduce() method. Despite its power, many developers find it intimidating at first. In this article, we'll break it down using real-world examples involving **users**, **departments**, roles—and even **salaries**.

Let's walk through two practical functions that use **reduce** to transform data into more useful structures.

## 1. Grouping Users by Department and Role

Suppose we have a list of **users**, and we want to group them by their department and then by their role within that department.

Here's how it's done using reduce:

```ts
export const groupUsersByDepartmentAndRole = (
  users:
    | Array<{
        name: string;
        department: string;
        role: string;
      }>
    | null
    | undefined
) => {
  if (!Array.isArray(users)) return {};

  return users.reduce<Record<string, Record<string, string[]>>>((acc, user) => {
    if (!acc[user.department]) {
      acc[user.department] = {};
    }

    if (!acc[user.department][user.role]) {
      acc[user.department][user.role] = [];
    }

    acc[user.department][user.role].push(user.name);

    return acc;
  }, {});
};
```

## What's Happening Here?

- We check if the input is a valid array.
- We use reduce to loop through each user.
- We build a nested object where:
  - Top-level keys are **departments**.
  - Second-level keys are **roles**.
  - The values are arrays of **user names**.

## Example Input:

```ts
[
  { name: "Alice", department: "Sales", role: "Manager" },
  { name: "Bob", department: "Engineering", role: "Developer" },
  { name: "Charlie", department: "Sales", role: "Associate" },
  { name: "Dave", department: "Sales", role: "Manager" },
];
```

## Output:

```ts
{
  Sales: {
    Manager: ["Alice", "Dave"],
    Associate: ["Charlie"]
  },
  Engineering: {
    Developer: ["Bob"]
  }
}
```

## 2. Summing Salaries by Department

Another powerful use of **reduce** is aggregation—like calculating totals.

Here's a function that totals up salaries by department:

```ts
export const sumSalariesByDepartment = (
  users:
    | Array<{
        name: string;
        department: string;
        salary: number;
      }>
    | null
    | undefined
) => {
  if (!Array.isArray(users)) return {};

  return users.reduce<Record<string, number>>((acc, user) => {
    if (!acc[user.department]) {
      acc[user.department] = 0;
    }

    acc[user.department] += user.salary;

    return acc;
  }, {});
};
```

## Test Cases:

```ts
describe("sumSalariesByDepartment", () => {
  const users = [
    { name: "Alice", department: "Sales", salary: 5000 },
    { name: "Bob", department: "Engineering", salary: 7000 },
    { name: "Charlie", department: "Sales", salary: 6000 },
  ];

  it("returns a sum of salaries object by department", () => {
    expect(sumSalariesByDepartment(users)).toEqual({
      Sales: 11000,
      Engineering: 7000,
    });
  });

  it("returns an empty object if non-array is passed", () => {
    expect(sumSalariesByDepartment(null)).toEqual({});
  });
});
```

## Why Use reduce?

The .reduce() method is great for:

- Converting arrays into objects
- Aggregating or summarizing data
- Transforming data into any shape you need

It may seem complex at first, but as you've seen, it can significantly simplify data transformations that would otherwise require verbose looping logic.

## Final Thoughts

The more you use **reduce**, the more powerful it becomes. With just a single method, you can restructure, group, and summarize your data elegantly. Try using it in your own projects—you'll quickly see its potential.
